# Welcome to the QuickStart-Backend repository! 
**This template is designed to help you quickly set up a backend project using Node.js with Express and MongoDB. Whether you're building an API or a full-stack application, this project serves as a solid foundation to kick-start your development.**

## Features

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **dotenv**: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- **bcryptjs**: Library to hash passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware to parse cookies.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is used for uploading files.
- **Cloudinary**: Image and video uploading and management service to store media files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or any other database of your choice)
- An account with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for image uploading.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   - With Folder ðŸ“‚
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/GirishChauhan15/Backend-Starter-Template.git
     ```
     
   - Without Folder ðŸ“‚
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/GirishChauhan15/Backend-Starter-Template.git .
      ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   - With Folder ðŸ“‚
     ```bash
     cd Backend-Starter-Template
     ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   
      ```bash
        npm install
      ```
      
4. Properly Eliminating the Git Repository:
   
      ```bash
        rm -rf .git
      ```
    
5. Start the application:
   
      ```bash
        npm run dev
      ```



### Folder Structure

  ```bash

  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ /src
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /controllers     # Controller files, handling business logic
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /db             # Database connection and configuration
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /middlewares     # Custom middleware for request handling
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /models          # Mongoose models

  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js           # Main application file
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constant.js      # Constants used throughout the application
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js         # Entry point for the application
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ .env.sample          # Sample environment variables
  â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore           # Files and directories to be ignored by Git
  â”œâ”€â”€ .prettierignore      # Files to be ignored by Prettier
  â”œâ”€â”€ .prettierrc          # Prettier configuration file
  â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json    # Automatically generated file for npm dependencies
  â””â”€â”€ package.json         # Node.js application manifest
  ```

## Usage

You can customize and extend this template as needed. 

- To add new routes, create a new file in the `/src/routes` directory and import it in `index.js`.
- Define your models in the `/src/models` directory.
- Implement your business logic in the `/src/controllers` directory.

## Authentication

Utilize `bcryptjs` for hashing passwords when creating users and `jsonwebtoken` for managing authentication with JWTs. 

You can set up middleware to protect routes that require authentication. For example, create a middleware function that verifies the JWT token and restricts access to protected routes.

## File Uploads

Use `Multer` for handling file uploads, and integrate it with `Cloudinary` for storing and managing your uploaded media.

1. Set up `Multer` middleware to handle incoming multipart/form-data requests.
2. After uploading a file, use the Cloudinary API to store the file and retrieve the URL for access.
